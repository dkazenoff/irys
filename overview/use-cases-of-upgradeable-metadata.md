# Use Cases of Upgradeable Metadata

### Where to Apply Upgradeable Metadata

Upgradeable NFT metadata powered by Irys enables a wide range of innovative use cases:

1. **Evolving Artwork**: NFTs that change appearance based on time, owner interactions, or external events.
2. **Dynamic Game Assets**: In-game items that level up or change properties as players progress.
3. **Real-world Asset Tracking**: NFTs representing physical assets with updatable information (e.g., property details, maintenance records).
4. **Interactive Storytelling**: NFTs that reveal new chapters or content over time or based on community decisions.
5. **Achievements and Badges**: NFTs that display earned accomplishments or status, updated as users complete tasks.
6. **Event Tickets**: NFTs that serve as access tokens, with metadata updates reflecting event changes or post-event memorabilia.
7. **Digital Identity**: NFTs representing user profiles or credentials that can be updated with new information or certifications.
8. **Collectible Sets**: NFTs that gain new attributes or appearances when collected as part of a set.
9. **Environmental Impact Tracking**: NFTs tied to real-world sustainability projects, updated with progress reports and impact metrics.
10. **Music and Media Releases**: NFTs that grant access to evolving content libraries or exclusive releases over time.
