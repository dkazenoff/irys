Upgradeable NFT metadata is a powerful feature that allows NFT creators and projects to modify the metadata associated with their tokens after minting. This metadata might be an image, video, gif, or objects linking to any number of attributes. If this metadata can change over time, it can open up a world of new possibilities for dynamic, evolving NFTs that can evolve intelligently in response to specific events.&#x20;

Irys, a decentralized storage solution built on Arweave, plays an instrumental role in implementing upgradeable NFT metadata. By leveraging Irys, developers can store and update NFT metadata in a permanent, censorship-resistant manner. Traditional IPFS nodes are non-permanent and highly susceptible to being taken offline or altering data unfairly.

This documentation will guide you through the process of implementing upgradeable NFT metadata using Irys and smart contracts - starting with Ethereum. We'll cover everything from the basic use cases followed by practical implementation - including code examples and best practices.
